DiDi Business Intelligence Challenge - Churn Prediction and Visitor Analysis
Project Overview
This project addresses several key business intelligence challenges using the DiDi dataset. We focus on analyzing visitor patterns, calculating week-over-week growth, forecasting future visitor trends, and predicting potential churn of DiDi app users based on a variety of features.

Key Points Covered:
Top 5 Restaurants with Highest Average Visitors on Holidays: Using SQL queries, we identified restaurants that experience the highest average number of visitors during holidays.
Day of the Week with the Most Visitors: SQL analysis was performed to determine which day of the week typically sees the highest average number of visitors.
Week-over-Week Growth: We calculated the percentage growth in the number of visitors over the last four weeks, using time series aggregation.
Visitor Forecast for the Next Six Months: Using exponential smoothing, we forecasted the total number of visitors for the next 180 days (approximately six months).
Strategies to Double Visitor Numbers: We proposed disruptive and data-driven strategies for increasing visitors based on traffic patterns, personalization, and geo-localized marketing efforts.
Additional Data for Insight: Suggested integrating external data sources such as weather, traffic, social media sentiment, and demographic information to further increase insights and visitor numbers.
App Download Channels: Identified key channels such as social media, Google Ads, and referral programs, along with a high-cost TV advertising option, to drive app downloads and estimate their cost-effectiveness.
Churn Prediction: Proposed an analytical approach to predict potential app churners using features like usage frequency, time since the last trip, payment method, trip ratings, and customer service interactions.

Conclusion
This project uses a combination of SQL queries, machine learning, and data analysis to tackle real-world business intelligence challenges. By leveraging historical data and additional insights, we propose actionable strategies to increase app downloads, prevent churn, and boost visitor numbers at restaurants.

This project was supported by ChatGPT (OpenAI), Grammarly & Gemini, providing guidance and analytical insights throughout the process. Various analytical methods, SQL queries, and machine learning techniques were used.
